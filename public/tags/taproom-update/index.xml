      <description>Although work has been going on throughout the building as you can see in the picture above our big push over the past two weeks has been in our brew house area. Plumbing, electrical and gas installs are complete to all of the necessary areas and all the brew house vessels and cellar tanks are upright and in their respective areas waiting for our friends at Premier Stainless Systems to join us on Monday, November 27th.</description>
