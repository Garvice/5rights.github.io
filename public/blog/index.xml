      <description>During this time of year we often try and slow down and take the time to remember all of the blessings that we often take for granted. With the frantic pace of our everyday lives it is easy to forget how many blessings that we truly experience on a daily basis, especially those we get to live out our days with. Sometimes keeping our &amp;ldquo;eye on the prize&amp;rdquo; makes us forget that we already have some amazing prizes if we would only choose to take time and appreciate them.</description>
