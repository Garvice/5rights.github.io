During this time of year we often try and slow down and take the time to remember all of the blessings that we often take for granted. With the frantic pace of our everyday lives it is easy to forget how many blessings that we truly experience on a daily basis, especially those we get to live out our days with. Sometimes keeping our "eye on the prize" makes us forget that we already have some amazing prizes if we would only choose to take time and appreciate them.

However, the holidays can also remind us of some of the struggles and difficulties that accompany those blessings and it's not lost on us how difficult these times can be. It seems that the further we get into this unbelievably amazing journey the more challenges are thrown our way that have the potential to crowd out the blessings. We would be disingenuous at best to act like we don't truly understand these struggles and that we have it all together.

So what are we trying to say to you all? We simply want to take a minute to thank all of you for your love, encouragement and support on this journey with us. We are grateful for all of you and what you contribute to this thing we call the 5 Rights Family. We pray that this holiday season will be a true blessing to you and that you will get to enjoy the gifts that you have as well as appreciate the struggles that we all share as they give us perspective and balance to live our lives by. We're not in this life alone and it's great to be surrounded by so many incredibly giving people. Cheers to real people!
