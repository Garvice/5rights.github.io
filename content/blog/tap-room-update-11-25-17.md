Although work has been going on throughout the building as you can see in the picture above our big push over the past two weeks has been in our brew house area. Plumbing, electrical and gas installs are complete to all of the necessary areas and all the brew house vessels and cellar tanks are upright and in their respective areas waiting for our friends at Premier Stainless Systems to join us on Monday, November 27th. The plan is to set and level all of the tanks, secure them in their permanent locations, finish building the process piping for the brew house and make all of the necessary connections to make everything operational. Once that is complete we will be ready for our Washington State Liquor Control Board site inspection and another step closer to brewing. If all goes well with that inspection and our temporary occupancy from the City of Lake Stevens then we could be brewing within a few weeks. We are so excited to finally put that beautiful stainless to good use.

As we move forward in the brew house area we are still working hard to finish off the front of house build out and infrastructure elements of the building. We have completed our fire system and domestic water tie in to PUD and have passed the sprinkler system inspections as well. We should be seeing our new gas and water meter installs over the next couple of weeks which will complete all of our necessary infrastructure improvements. Then we will shift all of our attention to finishing off the public areas inside the building and the parking lot and grounds improvements.
                                                                      
As always we are thankful for all of your encouragement and support during what seems a Herculean effort to make our new Lake Stevens home a reality. We know it seems like it is taking forever and we're right there with you. Thanks for being patient with us. We can assure you that we are taking all of the steps to make sure to do it RIGHT and make this place exactly what you would expect from 5 Rights.
